COMPILE TOOLS
===============
Note that Open Watcom 1.9.0 somehow miscompiles SDL-1.2.15 (or
something is wrong in its crt) therefore a newer version is needed:

* Open Watcom 'unofficial' V2 fork:
  - http://open-watcom.github.io/open-watcom/
  - https://github.com/open-watcom/
  - https://github.com/open-watcom/travis-ci-ow-builds

* Open Watcom snapshot builds from 'official' perforce repository:
  - https://efbe.musca.uberspace.de/
